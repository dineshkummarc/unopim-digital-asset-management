## Installation with Composer

- Run the following command:
   ```bash
   composer require unopim/dam
   ```

- Run the command to execute migrations and clear the cache:
   ```bash
   php artisan dam-package:install;
   php artisan optimize:clear;
   ```
- Start the queue to execute actions, such as job operations, by running the following command:
    ```bash
      php artisan queue:work
    ```
- If the queue:work command is managed by a process manager like Supervisor, restart the relevant service after installing the module to apply the changes. Replace unopim-worker with your actual worker name, if different:
     ```bash
     sudo supervisorctl restart unopim-worker
     ```
